# 🌐 GlucoVision — Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitoring 💧📊

> **Revolutionizing diabetes care** with a painless, tear-based optical glucose monitoring solution. No needles. Just few tear drops. 👁️✨

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**GlucoVision** is a **non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device** that leverages **optical sensing technology** to measure glucose levels in **tear fluid** — eliminating the need for finger pricks or blood samples.  

It offers a **painless**, **real-time**, and **affordable** solution to track glucose levels, especially benefiting **economically disadvantaged communities**. 🩺🌍

## 🌟 Key Features

✅ **Non-Invasive** — No needles, no blood!  
👁️ **Tear-Based Measurement** — Optical sensors analyze tear fluid.  
⚡ **Real-Time Monitoring** — Instant glucose level updates.  
💸 **Affordable & Accessible** — Built for low-resource settings.  
☁️ **Cloud Connectivity** — Data upload to Consentium Inc. for remote tracking.

## 🔬 How It Works

1. 👁️ A **tear sample** is collected near the eye.  
2. ⚗️ A **reaction occurs** in a custom-designed reaction cell.  
3. 🔦 An **optical transceiver** detects the *end time* of the reaction.  
4. 📈 The **reaction time** correlates with blood glucose concentration.  
5. 📲 The glucose level is **displayed locally** or **sent to the cloud**.
