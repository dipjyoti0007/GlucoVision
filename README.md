### 🧪 How We Do It

🔬 **Bio-specimen**  
• Utilizes **tear fluid** — a naturally available, non-invasive medium.

⚗️ **Reaction Mechanism**  
• A **chemical reaction** takes place in a micro reaction cell using the tear sample.  
• Over time, it produces a **colorless compound** indicating glucose concentration.

🔦 **Optical Detection**  
• An **optical transceiver** detects the **end-point** of the reaction.  
• The **reaction time** is directly proportional to the **glucose concentration**.

📏 **Sensor Calibration**  
• Calibrated using **standard glucose solutions** for accuracy.
