GlucoVision

üìå Project Overview

GlucoVision is a non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device that utilizes optical sensors to measure glucose levels in tear fluid. Unlike traditional methods that require blood samples, GlucoVision provides a painless and convenient way to track glucose levels in real time.

üåü Features

Non-invasive: No need for blood samples.

Tear-based Measurement: Uses optical sensors to detect glucose in tear fluid.

Real-time Monitoring: Provides instant results.

Affordable & Accessible: Designed for economically disadvantaged communities.

Cloud Integration: Data can be sent to Consentium Inc. for online monitoring.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The device collects a tear sample.

A reaction occurs in a specialized reaction cell.

The end time of the reaction is detected by an optical transceiver.

This reaction time correlates with blood glucose concentration.

The final glucose level is displayed or sent to the cloud.

üîß Hardware Requirements

Optical Sensor 

Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32)

Reaction Cell for tear fluid analysis

Display Unit (OLED/LCD)

Power Supply

WiFi/Bluetooth Module (for cloud integration)
